      <p>Dogs are popular pets because they are usually playful, friendly, loyal and listen to humans. Owning a dog is a lot of work but it can be very rewarding. We rescue dogs from local high-kill shelters. We also take in dogs from local families.</p>

      <p>Owning any pet is good for your heart. Cats in particular lower your stress level—possibly since they don't require as much effort as dogs—and lower the amount of anxiety in your life. Petting a cat has a positive calming effect. Cats can be very playful, though some cats are more shy than others. We rescue stray cats from all over the area.</p>
